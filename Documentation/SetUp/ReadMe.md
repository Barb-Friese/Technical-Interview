## Useful Software

The following are links to useful software for contributing to this and other Protect My Car Database Repositories and the order they should be installed.

1. [SQL Server Management Studio 18.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017) - Install the latest version that is compatible with SQL Server 2017.
2. [SQL Server 2017 Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express) - At a minimum you can follow the [Installation and configuration guide](/docs/InstallSQL17LocalDB.md). LocalDB should be all you need, but you can install the database engine if you'd like.
3. [Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Make sure to install the ASP.NET and Web Application Development "workload".
